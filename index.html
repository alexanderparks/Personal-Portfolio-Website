			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Alexander Parks and I am currently a third-year student at UT-Austin double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics!
			<p></p>
			During my time at UT, I have explored my academic interests through involvement in various organizations, such as Machine Learning and 
			Data Science Club (MLDS), the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists (HACS), and the Computer Science Transfers' Society (CSTS), 
			the latter of which I am sitting Treasurer. Furthermore, I have taken critical courses such as Data Structures, Software Engineering, 
			Computer Organization and Architecture, Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory, Geometry of Space, Probability I, and Differential Equations 
			with Linear Algebra.
			<p></p>
			My main academic interests include statistics, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and 
			actuarial science. I am currently searching for internship opportunities in these areas for Summer 2024. Outside of academics, my hobbies 
			and interests include traveling, sports, music, and films. Please, feel free to check out the rest of my page and contact me via email or phone!</p>
